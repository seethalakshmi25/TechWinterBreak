// Question 6: 
//Write a function named sumOrDifference that takes two numbers as parameters. If both are even, return their sum; if both are odd, return their difference 
//and if both are different return -1.

let sum = 0 ;
let diff = 0;
function sumOrDifference(num1,num2)
{
    if(num1&&num2%2==0)
    {
        sum = num1 + num2;
        return sum;
    }
    else if(num1&&num2%2!=0)
    {
        diff = num1 - num2;
        return diff;
    }
    else
    {
        return -1 ;
    }
}





//for testing outputs
console.log(sumOrDifference(2, 4)); 
// Expected Output: 6 (Even sum)
console.log(sumOrDifference(3, 5)); 
// Expected Output: -2 (Odd difference)
console.log(sumOrDifference(2, 3)); 
// Expected Output: -1 (One even, one odd)
